# Sign_Language_Recognition_using_DeepLearning
Sign_Language_Recognition_using_DeepLearning is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that uses OpenCV for hand tracking and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras for gesture classification. The project is designed to recognize and classify various sign language gestures through a live webcam feed.
